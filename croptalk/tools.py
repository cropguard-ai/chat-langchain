    This tool is used to query the summary of business data (SOB) to retrieve insurance program metrics by coverage level.

    Those metric can be percentage liability indemnified (pct_liability_indemnified), cost to grower (cost_to_grower),
    the number of policies sold (policies_sold_count) or the premium per quantity (premium_per_quantity)

    For instance, a user might ask : "What is the percentage of policies indemnified for Pierce county in North Dakota,
    for sunflowers under the APH program?". The tool will answer this question with the following arguments:

    Args:
        state_abbreviation: two letter string of State abbreviation (California -> CA, North Dakota -> ND and so on)
        county_name: name of county provided
        commodity_name: name of commodity

        metric : choice from ["pct_liability_indemnified", "cost_to_grower", "policies_sold_count", "premium_per_quantity"]

    Returns: the tool returns a string which gives the coverage level with their
            associated percentage indemnified statistic
